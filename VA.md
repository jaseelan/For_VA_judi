# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment Process

---
## 1️⃣ Pre-Assessment Setup
### 🧰 Select Tools
Choose tools based on scope and targets:
- **OpenVAS**, **Nessus**, **Qualys**, **Nexpose** – Infrastructure scanning
- **Burp Suite**, **OWASP ZAP** – Web application testing
- **Nikto**, **Nmap**, **WhatWeb**, **Dirb**, **Gobuster** – Enumeration and scanning
---
## 2️⃣ Information Gathering (Reconnaissance)
- ✅ Identify live hosts (Ping sweep, Nmap)
- ✅ Discover open ports and services
- ✅ Banner grabbing and service enumeration
- ✅ Whois, DNS records, Shodan/Google dorking (Passive Recon)

---
## 3️⃣ Vulnerability Scanning

- 🔍 Run automated scanners (OpenVAS, Nessus, etc.)
- 📄 Capture identified vulnerabilities with CVSS scores
- 🔄 Validate results to eliminate false positives

---
## 4️⃣ Manual Verification
- 🧪 Cross-check critical findings manually
- 🔐 Inspect web applications (XSS, SQLi, IDOR, etc.)
- 🔄 Use Burp Suite or manual payloads for confirmation
---

## 5️⃣ Risk Analysis
- ⚖️ Categorize vulnerabilities based on:
  - Severity (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
  - CVSS score
  - Business impact
- 🔎 Map to MITRE ATT&CK or OWASP Top 10 (if relevant)
---
## 6️⃣ Remediation Recommendations

- 🛠️ Provide actionable remediation for each finding
- 💡 Suggest secure configurations and patches
- 🔄 Include validation steps for remediation success
---
## 7️⃣ Reporting
### 📊 Executive Summary
- Overall risk level
- Key statistics (e.g., number of critical vulnerabilities)
- Impact overview
### 📑 Technical Details
For each finding:
- Title and severity
- Description
- Affected systems
- Evidence (screenshots, logs, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Remediation recommendations
